# Upgrade Guide

## General Notes

## Upgrading To 13.0 From 12.x

### Minimum PHP Version

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1734

PHP 8.1 is now the minimum required version.

### OAuth2 Server

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1734

The `league/oauth2-server` Composer package which is utilized internally by Passport has been updated to 9.0, which adds additional types to method signatures. To ensure your application is compatible, you should review this package's complete [changelog](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#900---released-2024-05-13). 

### Client Secrets Hashed by Default

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1745

Passport now always hashes client secrets using Laravel's `Hash` facade. If you are currently storing your client secrets in plain text, you may invoke the `passport:hash` Artisan command to hash all of your existing client secrets:

    php artisan passport:hash

In light of this change, the `Passport::$hashesClientSecrets` property and `Passport::hashClientSecrets()` method has been removed.

### The User's Token Instance

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1755

When authenticating users via bearer tokens, the `User` model's `token` method now returns an instance of `Laravel\Passport\AccessToken` class instead of `Laravel\Passport\Token`.

### Personal Access Client Table and Model Removal

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1749

Passport's `oauth_personal_access_clients` table has been redundant and unnecessary for several release cycles. Therefore, this release of Passport no longer interacts with this table or its corresponding model. If you wish, you may create a migration that drops this table:

    Schema::drop('oauth_personal_access_clients');

In addition, the `Laravel\Passport\PersonalAccessClient` model, `Passport::$personalAccessClientModel` property, `Passport::usePersonalAccessClientModel()`, `Passport::personalAccessClientModel()`, and `Passport::personalAccessClient()` methods have been removed.

## Upgrading To 12.0 From 11.x

### Migration Changes

Passport 12.0 no longer automatically loads migrations from its own migrations directory. Instead, you should run the following command to publish Passport's migrations to your application:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=passport-migrations
```

### Password Grant Type

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1715

The password grant type is disabled by default. You may enable it by calling the `enablePasswordGrant` method in the `boot` method of your application's `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class:

```php
public function boot(): void
{
    Passport::enablePasswordGrant();
}
```

## Upgrading To 11.0 From 10.x

### Minimum PHP Version

PHP 8.0 is now the minimum required version.

### Minimum Laravel Version

Laravel 9.0 is now the minimum required version.

### Reverting Model DB Connection Customization

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1412

Customizing model database connections through the migration files has been reverted. This was first introduced in [this PR](https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1255). 

If you need to customize the database connection for a model you should override the models [as explained in the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/passport#overriding-default-models).

### Allow Timestamps On Token model

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1425

Timestamps are now allowed on the `Token` model. If you specifically didn't want these model's timestamps to be updated then you may override the `Token` model [as explained in the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/passport#overriding-default-models).

### Refactor Routes To Dedicated File

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1464

Passport's routes have been moved to a dedicated route file. You can remove the `Passport::routes()` call from your application's service provider.

If you previously relied on overwriting routes using `routes($callback = null, array $options = [])` you may now achieve the same behavior by simply overwriting the routes in your application's own `web.php` route file.

### Stubbing Client In Tests

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1519

Previously, a stubbed client created via `Passport::actingAsClient(...)` wasn't retrieved when calling the `->client()` method on the API guard. This has been fixed in Passport v11 to reflect real-world situations and you may need to accommodate for this behavior in your tests.

### Scope Inheritance In Tests

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1551

Previously, scopes weren't inherited when using `Passport::actingAs(...)`. This has been fixed in Passport v11 to reflect real-world situations and you may need to accommodate for this behavior in your tests.

## Upgrading To 10.0 From 9.x

### Minimum PHP Version

PHP 7.3 is now the minimum required version.

### Minimum Laravel Version

Laravel 8.0 is now the minimum required version.

### Old Static Personal Client Methods Removed

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1325

The personal client configuration methods have been removed from the `Passport` class since they are no longer necessary. You should remove any calls to these methods from your application's service providers.

## Upgrading To 9.0 From 8.x

### Support For Multiple Guards

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1220

Passport now has support for multiple guard user providers. Because of this change, you must add a `provider` column to the `oauth_clients` database table:

    Schema::table('oauth_clients', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->string('provider')->after('secret')->nullable();
    });

If you have not previously published the Passport migrations, you should manually add the `provider` column to your database.

### Client Credentials Secret Hashing

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1145

Client secrets may now be stored using a Bcrypt hash. However, before enabling this functionality, please consider the following. First, there is no way to reverse the hashing process once you have migrated your existing tokens. Secondly, when hashing client secrets, you will only have one opportunity to display the plain-text value to the user before it is hashed and stored in the database.

#### Personal Access Clients

Before you continue, you should set your personal access client ID and unhashed secret in your `.env` file:

    PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID=client-id-value
    PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET=unhashed-client-secret-value

Next, you should register these values by placing the following calls within the `boot` method of your `AppServiceProvider`:

    Passport::personalAccessClientId(config('passport.personal_access_client.id'));
    Passport::personalAccessClientSecret(config('passport.personal_access_client.secret'));

> Make sure you follow the instructions above before hashing your secrets. Otherwise, irreversible data loss may occur.

#### Hashing Existing Secrets

You may enable client secret hashing by calling the `Passport::hashClientSecrets()` method within the `boot` method of your `AppServiceProvider`. For convenience, we've included a new Artisan command which you can run to hash all existing client secrets:

    php artisan passport:hash

**Again, please be aware that running this command cannot be undone. For extra precaution, you may wish to create a backup of your database before running the command.**

### Client Credentials Middleware Changes

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1132

[After a lengthy debate](https://github.com/laravel/passport/issues/1125), it was decided to revert the change made [in a previous PR](https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1040) that introduced an exception when the client credentials middleware was used to authenticate first party clients.

### Switch From `getKey` To `getAuthIdentifier`

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1134

Internally, Passport will now use the `getAuthIdentifier` method to determine a model's primary key. This is consistent with the framework and Laravel's first party libraries.

### Remove Deprecated Functionality

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1235

The deprecated `revokeOtherTokens` and `pruneRevokedTokens` methods and the `revokeOtherTokens` and `pruneRevokedTokens` properties were removed from the `Passport` object.


## Upgrading To 8.0 From 7.x

### Minimum & Upgraded Versions

Commit: https://github.com/laravel/passport/commit/97e3026790d953d7a67fe487e30775cd995e93df

The minimum Laravel version is now v6.0 and the minimum PHP version is now 7.2. The underlying `league/oauth2-server` has also been updated to v8.

### Public Clients

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1065

Passport now supports public clients and PCKE. To leverage this feature, you should update the the `secret` column of the `oauth_clients` table to be `nullable`:

    Schema::table('oauth_clients', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->string('secret', 100)->nullable()->change();
    });

### Renderable Exceptions For OAuth Errors

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1066

OAuth exceptions can now be rendered. They will first be converted to Passport exceptions. If you are explicitly handling `League\OAuth2\Server\Exception\OAuthServerException` in your exception handler's report method you will now need to check for an instance of `Laravel\Passport\Exceptions\OAuthServerException` instead.

### Fixed Credential Checking

PR: https://github.com/laravel/passport/pull/1040

In the previous versions of Passport, you could pass tokens granted by a different client type to the `CheckClientCredential` and `CheckClientCredentialForAnyScope` middleware. This behavior has been corrected and an exception will be thrown if you attempt to pass a token generated by a different client type.
